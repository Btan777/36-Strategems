                <div class="stratagem-title">1. Keep Your Mouth Shut About Your Plans</div>
                <div class="illustration">🤐💡</div>
                <p>The moment you tell people about your brilliant idea, suddenly everyone becomes an expert with "suggestions."</p>
                <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Don't announce your diet on social media. The same people who eat pizza for breakfast will suddenly become nutritionists.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="stratagem">
                <div class="stratagem-title">2. Attack Their Weakness</div>
                <div class="illustration">🎯🦶</div>
                <p>Everyone has that one thing that makes them crumble. Find it, but use it wisely.</p>
                <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Your boss loves tech buzzwords. Call your idea "leveraging synergistic digital solutions" instead of "that thing I saw on TikTok."</div>
            </div>

                <div class="stratagem-title">3. Make Others Do Your Dirty Work</div>
                <div class="illustration">🎭👥</div>
                <p>Why be the bad guy when you can get someone else to deliver the bad news?</p>
                <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of confronting your messy roommate, mention how your friend's roommate got kicked out for being a slob. Let them connect the dots.</div>
            </div>

                <div class="stratagem-title">4. Let Them Exhaust Themselves</div>
                <div class="illustration">😴🏃</div>
                <p>Sometimes the best strategy is to grab popcorn and watch your enemies defeat themselves.</p>
                <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Your coworker is ranting in the meeting. Just nod sympathetically while they dig their own grave with the boss.</div>
            </div>

                <p>When everyone's distracted by drama, that's your moment to strike.</p>
                <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> While everyone's gossiping about the office romance, quietly submit your vacation request. It'll get approved unnoticed.</div>

            <div class="stratagem">
                <div class="stratagem-title">6. Create Something from Nothing</div>
                <div class="illustration">✨🎩</div>
                <p>Master the art of making a big deal out of absolutely nothing.</p>
                <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Turn "I organized my email" into "I implemented a comprehensive digital workflow optimization system."</div>

                <div class="illustration">🎪🎭</div>
                <p>Sometimes you need to create the appearance of something that doesn't exist.</p>
                <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Put important-looking books on your Zoom background. Nobody needs to know they're all cookbooks and romance novels.</div>

                <div class="illustration">🍿👀</div>
                <p>Sometimes the best move is no move. Let your enemies destroy each other.</p>
                <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> Two coworkers fighting over a promotion? Don't pick sides - just keep doing good work while they sabotage each other.</div>
